# Assignment 4 Readme

## Setting up the environment
First I created a new environment to be able to complete this assignment. I only installed conda bioforge and jupyterlab, so I expect to be updating my environment consistently throughout this assignment to be able to complete the tutorial.

I used .gitignore to ignore all the .ipynbcheckpoint/ folders.

Upon looking at my environment file, I'm realizing there are a tonnnnn of dependencies there that I didn't mean to add myself. Not sure how they really got there as I created the environment in the terminal. I manually had to add pandas, scipy, matplot, and seaborn. I decided to delete all of the excess dependencies and add numpy as well.

## Beginning the Stats in Python Tutorial

- We want to use python for this because it makes powerful pipelines
- will be storing and manipulating data in a file called pandas.datafrome
- I downloaded the csv file and had pandas read it into a table
- it is pretty cool how well python can manipulate this data
- use "groupby" to split a dataframe on values of categorical variables

The mean for Females VIQ is 109.45 and the mean for Males VIQ is 115.0. The mean for all groups VIQ is 115.25. There were 39 participants in the study.
